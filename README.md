# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is an exploration into Kickstarter campaigns to determine the success probability of upcoming campaign ideas and to strategize how to best position the campaigns for success.  

## American Play Overview
Theatrical plays have a great launching point with Kickstarter. 30% of all kickstarters are Theatrical in nature with 22% being plays. From this data set, the Theater category also showed strongly with a 57.6% success rate and Plays showed a 61.4% success rate. Successful Theatrical campaigns on average showed funding in excess of 110%. Below we will show the most effective traits of kickstarter campaigns related to theater, plays, and musicals. I will also address your interest in British plays and campaigns.

### Ideal United States Kickstarter Traits:
1. **Date Of Launch:** May shows a notable increase in the frequency of successful campain launches compared to any other month of the year. I recommend launching the campaign in May if possible and June as a secondary option as it ranked second.

2. **Goal Amounts:** Successful goal amounts for Theatrical US Kickstarters showed a median of $3,000 with amounts pledged having a median of $3,168. Unsuccessful goals had a median amount of $5,000. In this case, we see a greater number of campaigns failing as the goal amount moves toward $5,000. Note: Current data also shows average donations in the range of $95 and average backers to be about 82.

3. **Duration Of Campaign:** Campaing durations ranged from 3-90 days, however 30 days was without a doubt the most successful duration of campaign with 30.3% of all successful plays completing at the 30 day mark. I recommend limiting the duration of the campaign to 30 days.

4. One similar production you noted, Foresight, showed success with meeting their goal of $2,000 in 24 days. 

## British Play Note:
You mentioned 5 different plays that you enjoyed while traveling in Great Britain. All five were successful Kickstarter campaigns that completed in 30 days save for _The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Family_, which completed in 35 days. Average donations for these plays ranged between £33 and £52. Plays as a whole in Great Britain show a 75.8% success rate, however, much like American theater productions, target goals of higher amounts did not fit with the range of pledge amounts.

## Conclusion:
Given the overall statistical analysis, I feel that the greatest potential for success for an American theatrical campaign would be to begin the campain in May with a goal of $3,000 and a duration of 30 days. Please contaact me if you have any questions. Thank you!
